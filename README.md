# AICreviceDetectionInAntartica
AI for crevice detection in Antartica.
One week school project on the theme "Observing earth for cryosphere evolution". \
Possible improvements : more training data, testing on non-Antartica (Greenland?) glaciers and mountain glaciers
(this might need new models or new training).\

Extension of this work can be found at https://github.com/Nicolas-Quiot/AICrevassedetection \
\
Note : directories should be changed according to your computer and to file names.\
Please install keras, tensorflow, matplotlib, numpy and have a good python environnement for it to work. I recommend model_evaluation.py as the most complete evaluation file.\

Evaluation of said results using scores and the threshold for pixel detection :
