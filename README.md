# AICreviceDetectionInAntartica
AI for crevice detection in Antartica.
One week school project on the theme "Observing earth for cryosphere evolution". \
Possible improvements : more training data, testing on non-Antartica (Greenland?) glaciers and mountain glaciers
(this might need new models or new training).
